			<h2>Hi! I'm Trang</h2>
			<p>
				A swimmie 🧜‍♀️, a jogi 🧘‍♀️, a newbie in crocheting 🧶.<br/>
				I'm currently attending Hive Coding School. <br/>
				I hold a master degree in finance and worked 5 years as a financial controller. <br/>
				I worked intensively with financial data daily, understood and translated data to insightful and understandable reports. <br/>
				I like to explore the alternative solutions to automate repetitive tasks and increase time to brainstorm other pending problems.
